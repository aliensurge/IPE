# Abstract

WebGuard is a local security monitoring platform designed to address the critical cybersecurity needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by providing automated detection and notification capabilities for website defacement, downtime incidents, and SSL certificate expiry. This project was developed to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade monitoring solutions and the resource constraints faced by smaller organisations. The system utilises a Python-based backend monitoring engine integrated with a React-based dashboard interface, enabling real-time visibility into website security status. Through automated checks and Telegram-based notifications, WebGuard empowers SMEs to respond rapidly to security incidents and maintain operational continuity. The platform's local-first architecture ensures data sovereignty and eliminates recurring subscription costs, making professional-grade security monitoring accessible to businesses with limited IT budgets. This report documents the complete development lifecycle, from requirements analysis through to testing and deployment, demonstrating how open-source technologies can be leveraged to create effective security solutions for underserved market segments.
